# countdown_game_show
Simple implementation of the countdown game on Countdown! game show. 

This is for code that solves the countdown game.
A user inputs 6 integers, and a number to evaluate these to. eg. {[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 24}

The code will return whether or not that number was possible to obtain by left-to-right in-order mathematical operations. 
This means PEMDAS is not applied and no parentheses are used. The numbers are simply evaluated left to right.
