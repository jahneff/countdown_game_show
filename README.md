Simple implementation of the countdown game on Countdown! game show. 

This is for code that solves the countdown game.
A user inputs 6 integers, and a number to evaluate these to. eg. {[1, 2, 3.. 6], 24}

The code will return whether or not that number was possible to obtain by manipulating the integers, and if so, what equation produced that value.
